Modern Hospital Management System (MHMS)



 1. Introduction



 1.1 Purpose



The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to provide a comprehensive, detailed, and structured description of the Modern Hospital Management System (MHMS). This SRS acts as the single source of truth outlining system behavior, functional requirements, workflow logic, non-functional properties, constraints, and operational guidelines essential for development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.



 1.2 Scope



The MHMS is a cloud-based, web-enabled digital healthcare platform developed for private hospitals in Ethiopia. It automates patient registration, outpatient and inpatient workflows, laboratory operations, pharmacy dispensing, billing and insurance processing, HR and staff management, inventory monitoring, reporting, emergency triage, telemedicine, and patient self-service capabilities.

The system eliminates manual paper-based workflows, reduces patient waiting time, improves record accuracy, supports efficient healthcare service delivery, and enhances patient engagement through modern digital channels.
