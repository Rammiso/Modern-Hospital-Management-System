CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR 1 WEEK

Technical Decisions:

Use a UI framework (like Ant Design or Material-UI) - avoid building custom components

Use an admin template to save 2 days of UI work

Implement a database-first approach by designing all tables on Day 1

Adopt API-first development by defining endpoints before UI

Team Coordination:

Conduct daily 30-minute syncs at 9 AM and 5 PM

Maintain shared API documentation using Postman or Swagger

Create a common component library for buttons, forms, and tables

Ensure continuous integration by merging code multiple times per day

Scope Management:

Avoid fancy features such as SMS, email, insurance, and advanced reports

Allow paper backups as the system doesn't need to be perfect

Accept manual workarounds for edge cases

Focus on fixing only critical bugs, while minor issues can wait

Suggested Tech Stack for Speed:

Backend:Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM

Frontend:React + Ant Design/Material-UI

Database:MySQL with a hosted solution (like PlanetScale)

Deployment:Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)

Authentication:JWT with bcrypt
